translation.ipynb - the purpose of this file is to produce translated output of input as a string. It first identifies the language and then breaks down paragraphs into sentences. If the sentence has more than 512 characters, it would break it into parts with less than 512 characters. After splitting into sentences with parts having less than 512 characters, we translate the given language into English and then join all the sentences with full stops to form a paragraph. The output is stored as a string in a variable.
To generate the model files, we must run and train the two training model codes.
